\title{Prune Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) Network}
\usage{
prune_snf_network(snf_network, percentile_thr = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{snf_network}{A square, symmetric numeric matrix representing the SNF network.}

\item{percentile_thr}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the percentile threshold. Edges with weights above this percentile are retained in the pruned network.}
}
\value{
A pruned weighted adjacency matrix of the same dimensions as \code{snf_network}, with values corresponding to retained edge weights.
}
\description{
This function prunes an SNF network by setting edges above a specified percentile threshold to 1
and returning a weighted adjacency matrix where values correspond to the original edge weights.
}
\examples{
# Generate an example SNF network
snf_network <- matrix(runif(100, min = 0, max = 1), nrow = 10)
snf_network <- (snf_network + t(snf_network)) / 2  # Ensure symmetry
result <- prune_snf_network(snf_network, percentile_thr = 0.75)
}
