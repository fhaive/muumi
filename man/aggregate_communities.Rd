\usage{

  community_labels_list,
  n_aggregate_communities,
  max_iter = 1000,
  learning_rate = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{community_labels_list}{A list of community labels for different views.}

\item{n_aggregate_communities}{Number of aggregated communities to generate.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations for NMF optimization. Default is 1000.}

\item{learning_rate}{Learning rate for the NMF optimizer. Default is 0.001.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{aggregated_membership}{Transposed matrix of the H factor from NMF, representing the aggregated community memberships.}
\item{view_contributions}{Matrix of the contributions of each view to each aggregated community.}
}
}
\description{
This function aggregates community labels from multiple views (or datasets) into a unified set of community labels using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).
